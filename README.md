# A Python Exercise

**This is a simple python project from my early days as a Computer Science student**

_This programm was created for the second semester class Applied Algebra_

> #### Description of project
>
>>Write a program that receives an input with a permutation μ of [n] in the list format from natural numbers separated by the space character (eg 7 10 9 11 2 1 3 5 6 8 4) and prints the following information about the permutation μ.
>>1. The length of μ
>>2. The reverse of μ
>>3. The μ as the product of cycles
>>4. The μ as a product  of transpositions
>>5. The parity of μ
